First of all, just getting to the theater presents difficulties.
Leaving a home equipped with a TV and a video recorder isn't an attractive idea on a humid, cold, or rainy night.
Even if the weather cooperates, there is still a thirty-minute drive to the theater down a congested highway, followed by the hassle of looking for a parking space.
And then there are the lines.
After hooking yourself to the end of a human chain, you worry about whether there will be enough tickets, whether you will get seats together, and whether many people will sneak into the line ahead of you.
